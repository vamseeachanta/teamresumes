# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-24-github-portfolio-best-practices/spec.md

> Created: 2025-01-24
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- **Portfolio Structure Analysis** - Automated scanning of existing GitHub repositories to identify portfolio-ready content and suggest improvements
- **README Generation System** - Template-based README creation with dynamic content insertion based on repository analysis
- **LinkedIn Content Extraction** - Python script that parses markdown resumes and GitHub repositories to extract LinkedIn-formatted content
- **Content Validation** - Automated checks to ensure portfolio meets professional presentation standards
- **Template System** - Reusable templates for different types of technical projects and professional documentation
- **AI Integration Interface** - Command-line tool that accepts prompts and generates LinkedIn content from GitHub portfolio data

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Standalone Python Package
- Pros: Self-contained, easy installation, can be distributed to team
- Cons: Separate tool from existing workflow, requires additional setup

**Option B:** Integration with Existing TeamResumes System (Selected)
- Pros: Leverages existing markdown processing, fits current workflow, reuses established tooling
- Cons: Tightly coupled to current system, may require system modifications

**Option C:** GitHub Actions Based Solution**
- Pros: Automated execution, integrates with existing CI/CD, no local setup required
- Cons: Limited user interaction, complex debugging, execution environment constraints

**Rationale:** Option B integrates seamlessly with the existing TeamResumes system, allowing us to leverage current markdown processing capabilities and extend the system's value proposition without introducing new tooling overhead.
