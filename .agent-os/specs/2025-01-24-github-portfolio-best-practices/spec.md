> Spec: GitHub Portfolio Best Practices
> Created: 2025-01-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Develop comprehensive best practices and implementation strategies for GitHub-based work portfolios that enable direct employer sharing and seamless AI-powered LinkedIn profile updates. This feature will establish professional presentation standards and automation workflows for technical professionals.

## User Stories

### Direct Employer Sharing Story

As a technical professional, I want to send a direct GitHub link to potential employers, so that they can immediately view my professional portfolio, skills, and work samples without requiring additional document preparation or platform navigation.

**Detailed Workflow:** User shares a clean, professional GitHub repository URL that presents as a complete work portfolio with clear navigation, professional documentation, downloadable resume formats, and project showcases that demonstrate technical capabilities and professional growth.

### AI-Powered LinkedIn Integration Story

As a busy professional, I want to use an AI prompt to automatically update my LinkedIn profile from my GitHub portfolio, so that my online presence stays current without manual content management overhead.

**Detailed Workflow:** User runs an AI command that analyzes their GitHub portfolio content, extracts relevant skills, experiences, and achievements, then generates LinkedIn-formatted content sections (summary, experience bullets, skills list) that can be directly copied and pasted into LinkedIn profile sections.

### Professional Standards Story

As a team member, I want to follow established GitHub portfolio best practices, so that our team maintains consistent professional presentation standards and maximizes the effectiveness of our online presence for career opportunities.

**Detailed Workflow:** Team members access documented best practices covering repository structure, README formatting, project presentation, and professional documentation standards that ensure all portfolios meet employer expectations and professional standards.
