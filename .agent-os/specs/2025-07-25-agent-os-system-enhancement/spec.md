# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Agent OS System Level Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the Agent OS create-spec instruction to automatically generate an executive summary with high-level mermaid flowchart for all spec documentation across all repositories on this system. This system-level enhancement will improve spec comprehension and provide visual workflow representation for stakeholders across the entire Agent OS ecosystem.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the Agent OS system level enhancement spec to include:
- Additional mermaid diagram types or formats
- Enhanced executive summary templates
- Integration with other Agent OS workflows
- Support for different project types or complexity levels
Maintain compatibility with existing create-spec.md structure and ensure the enhancement works across all repository types.
```

## User Stories

### Enhanced Spec Comprehension

As a stakeholder reviewing specs, I want to see an executive summary with visual flowchart, so that I can quickly understand the spec's purpose, scope, and workflow without reading the entire document.

Stakeholders need immediate clarity on what a spec accomplishes, how it fits into the broader system, and what the implementation flow looks like. The executive summary and mermaid diagram should provide this at-a-glance understanding.

### Consistent Documentation Standards

As a developer using Agent OS across multiple repositories, I want all specs to include standardized executive summaries and flowcharts, so that I have consistent documentation quality and format regardless of the project.

All repositories using Agent OS should automatically generate specs with executive summaries and mermaid flowcharts, ensuring consistent documentation standards across the entire development ecosystem.

### Visual Workflow Understanding

As a team member implementing specs, I want to see the workflow visually represented, so that I understand the implementation sequence and dependencies before starting development.

The mermaid flowchart should clearly show the spec's implementation steps, decision points, and dependencies, making it easier to plan and execute the development work.

## Spec Scope

1. **Modify create-spec.md Instruction** - Update the global Agent OS create-spec instruction to include executive summary generation
2. **Executive Summary Template** - Define standardized template for spec executive summaries
3. **Mermaid Flowchart Generation** - Automatic generation of high-level workflow diagrams
4. **Integration with Existing Workflow** - Seamless integration with current create-spec process
5. **Cross-Repository Compatibility** - Ensure enhancement works across all repository types

## Out of Scope

- Modifying existing specs retroactively (future specs only)
- Complex mermaid diagrams beyond high-level workflow
- Interactive or dynamic diagrams
- Integration with external diagramming tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. Updated @~/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md with executive summary requirements
2. Executive summary template integrated into spec.md creation process
3. Mermaid flowchart generation rules and examples
4. Documentation for the enhanced create-spec workflow
