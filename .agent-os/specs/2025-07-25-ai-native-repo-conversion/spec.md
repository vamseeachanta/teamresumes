# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI-Native Repository Conversion Process Documentation
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Document the typical AI-native process to convert existing repositories to AI-native repositories, using the TeamResumes repository transformation as a case study. This will provide a standardized methodology for teams to follow when adopting AI-native development workflows.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the AI-native repo conversion process documentation to include:
- New conversion patterns or workflows discovered
- Additional tool integrations or frameworks
- Enhanced automation capabilities
- Lessons learned from additional repository conversions
Maintain compatibility with existing Agent OS structure and ensure the process remains applicable across different project types.
```

## User Stories

### Standardized Conversion Process

As a development team lead, I want a documented process for converting existing repositories to AI-native workflows, so that I can systematically adopt AI-assisted development practices across all our projects.

Teams need clear steps, expected outcomes, and best practices for transforming traditional repositories into AI-native ones. The process should be repeatable and adaptable to different project types and sizes.

### Historical Case Study Learning

As a developer implementing AI-native practices, I want to understand how a real repository was successfully converted, so that I can avoid common pitfalls and follow proven patterns.

The TeamResumes repository conversion provides concrete examples of file structures, commit patterns, and decision-making processes that led to successful AI-native adoption.

### Process Documentation for Knowledge Transfer

As an organization adopting AI-native development, I want comprehensive documentation of the conversion process, so that multiple teams can independently execute the transformation with consistent results.

Documentation should include both the strategic decisions and tactical implementation details needed to replicate the success across different repositories and teams.

## Spec Scope

1. **Conversion Process Documentation** - Step-by-step methodology for transforming traditional repos to AI-native
2. **TeamResumes Case Study Analysis** - Detailed examination of the actual conversion process used
3. **File Structure Templates** - Standard directory layouts and configuration files
4. **Best Practices Guide** - Lessons learned and recommended approaches
5. **Automation Scripts** - Tools to streamline the conversion process
6. **Validation Checklist** - Criteria for successful AI-native conversion

## Out of Scope

- Specific tool installation guides (focus on process over tools)
- Repository-specific business logic conversion
- Advanced AI integration beyond basic Agent OS setup
- Rollback or migration strategies

## Expected Deliverable

1. Comprehensive conversion process documentation with step-by-step instructions
2. TeamResumes repository case study with commit analysis and decision rationale
3. Template files and directory structures for AI-native repositories
4. Automation scripts or tools to assist with the conversion process
