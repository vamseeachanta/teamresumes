# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-25-ai-native-repo-conversion/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-25
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Document the complete AI-native conversion process based on real implementation
- Analyze actual commit history and file changes from TeamResumes conversion
- Create reusable templates and automation scripts
- Provide validation criteria for successful conversion
- Ensure process works across different repository types and sizes
- Include both Agent OS and Claude Code integration patterns

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Generic Process Documentation
- Pros: Broadly applicable, technology-agnostic, easier to maintain
- Cons: Lacks specific examples, harder to follow, may miss important details

**Option B:** Case Study-Driven Documentation (Selected)
- Pros: Real examples, proven process, concrete outcomes, actionable steps
- Cons: May be too specific to TeamResumes, requires adaptation for other repos

**Option C:** Tool-Specific Documentation
- Pros: Detailed tool integration, step-by-step commands, immediate applicability
- Cons: Becomes outdated quickly, tool vendor lock-in, less strategic focus

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of practical guidance and reusable methodology. The TeamResumes case study offers concrete evidence of successful conversion while maintaining enough generality to apply to other repositories.

### Pre-Conversion State (Before July 24, 2025)
Based on commit `b339734` and earlier, the repository contained:

```

### Conversion Process (July 24-25, 2025)

#### Phase 1: Agent OS Installation (Commit `62cdbfc`)
**Files Added:**
```
.agent-os/
├── product/
│   ├── mission.md          # Product vision and purpose
│   ├── tech-stack.md       # Technical architecture
│   ├── roadmap.md          # Development phases
│   └── decisions.md        # Decision log
└── CLAUDE.md               # AI agent integration
```

**Key Changes:**
- Analyzed existing codebase and functionality
- Documented current state and completed features
- Created structured product documentation
- Established AI-native workflow patterns

#### Phase 2: Claude Code Integration (Commits `55aab75`, `112d5ad`)
**Files Added:**
```
.claude/
├── claude-code-cheatsheet.md    # Quick reference guide
└── settings.local.json          # Tool configuration

.agent-os/specs/
└── [various spec folders]       # Feature specifications
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added Claude Code tooling integration
- Created user-friendly documentation
- Established spec-driven development workflow
- Configured AI assistant permissions and settings

### Post-Conversion State

The repository now exhibits AI-native characteristics:
- Structured documentation for AI consumption
- Spec-driven development workflow
- AI assistant integration and configuration
- Clear separation of product vision and implementation
- Automated workflow support

## AI-Native Conversion Methodology

### Phase 1: Assessment and Analysis
1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Analyze existing file structure and organization
   - Identify core functionality and features
   - Document current tech stack and dependencies
   - Review existing documentation and processes

2. **Stakeholder Context Gathering**
   - Interview product owners and developers
   - Understand business objectives and user needs
   - Identify pain points in current workflow
   - Clarify future development priorities

### Phase 2: Agent OS Foundation
1. **Install Agent OS Framework**
   - Create `.agent-os/product/` directory structure
   - Generate `mission.md` with product vision
   - Document `tech-stack.md` with current architecture
   - Create `roadmap.md` showing completed and planned features
   - Establish `decisions.md` for architectural choices

2. **Create AI Integration Point**
   - Add `CLAUDE.md` in project root
   - Configure Agent OS documentation references
   - Establish workflow instructions for AI agents
   - Set up cross-reference system for documentation

### Phase 3: AI Tooling Integration
1. **Claude Code Configuration**
   - Create `.claude/` directory
   - Add `settings.local.json` with appropriate permissions
   - Configure tool access and security settings
   - Test AI assistant functionality

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Create user-friendly cheatsheets and guides
   - Document AI-native workflows and patterns
   - Establish consistent formatting and structure
   - Add troubleshooting and best practices

### Phase 4: Workflow Transformation
1. **Spec-Driven Development**
   - Create `.agent-os/specs/` directory structure
   - Establish spec creation and management workflows
   - Document feature development process
   - Integrate with existing build and deployment processes

2. **Team Onboarding**
   - Create onboarding documentation for AI-native workflows
   - Train team members on new processes and tools
   - Establish code review and quality processes
   - Monitor adoption and gather feedback
