## Overview

Create a comprehensive cheatsheet for Claude Code that provides quick reference for team members using Claude Code CLI within the TeamResumes project. This will improve efficiency when working with Claude Code commands, keyboard shortcuts, and common workflows.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the Claude Code cheatsheet spec to include:
- New Claude Code features or commands
- Additional keyboard shortcuts
- Updated workflow patterns
- Common troubleshooting scenarios
Maintain compatibility with Claude Code documentation and ensure the cheatsheet remains concise and practical.
```

## User Stories

### Quick Command Reference

As a developer, I want to quickly reference Claude Code commands and shortcuts, so that I can work efficiently without interrupting my flow to search documentation.

Developers need immediate access to command syntax, keyboard shortcuts, and common patterns. They should be able to find the right command or shortcut within seconds while actively coding.

### Workflow Optimization

As a team member, I want to understand Claude Code best practices and workflows, so that I can leverage its full capabilities for the TeamResumes project.

Team members should understand how to use Claude Code effectively for resume management tasks, including file operations, bulk updates, and integration with the existing build system.

## Spec Scope

1. **Command Reference** - All Claude Code CLI commands with syntax and examples
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts** - Complete list of keyboard shortcuts for interactive mode
3. **Common Workflows** - Step-by-step guides for frequent TeamResumes tasks
4. **Configuration Tips** - Settings and environment setup for optimal use
5. **Integration Guide** - How Claude Code works with existing TeamResumes scripts

## Out of Scope

- Full Claude Code documentation reproduction
- Installation instructions (assumed already installed)
- API reference or advanced customization
- Modifications to Claude Code itself

## Expected Deliverable

1. A single markdown file (claude-code-cheatsheet.md) in the .claude folder
2. Clear sections with visual separation for quick scanning
3. TeamResumes-specific examples and use cases
