# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Agent OS Integration Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-30
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Complete the Agent OS integration for the team resumes platform by implementing missing workflows, enhancing collaborative documentation standards, and establishing robust content management processes that align with web development best practices for professional team profile management.

## User Stories

### Team Lead Workflow Enhancement

As a team lead, I want to use Agent OS workflows to systematically manage team resume updates and improvements, so that I can maintain consistent professional documentation standards and efficiently coordinate team profile enhancements through structured specs and tasks.

The workflow should include spec creation for new resume features, task breakdown for implementation, and collaborative review processes that ensure all team member profiles maintain professional quality and consistency.

### Content Management Standardization

As a team member, I want clear Agent OS-driven processes for updating my professional profile, so that I can contribute to the team's professional documentation without worrying about formatting inconsistencies or breaking existing automation.

This includes guided workflows for adding new experiences, skills, or certifications, with validation processes that ensure changes integrate smoothly with the existing markdown-to-PDF conversion pipeline.

### Collaborative Documentation Workflow

As a technical professional using this platform, I want Agent OS to provide structured approaches for enhancing the resume platform itself, so that improvements to the system are well-documented, tested, and align with the team's professional documentation goals.

## Spec Scope

1. **Agent OS Workflow Completion** - Implement missing Agent OS components and workflows for systematic feature development
2. **Content Management Standards** - Establish clear processes for team member profile updates and validation
3. **Collaborative Documentation Enhancement** - Improve cross-team coordination on professional documentation standards
4. **Web Development Integration** - Align Agent OS workflows with the platform's markdown-to-web conversion pipeline
5. **Professional Profile Quality Assurance** - Implement validation and review processes for team resume consistency

## Out of Scope

- Major changes to the existing markdown-to-PDF conversion pipeline
- Complete redesign of the current file structure
- Integration with external resume platforms or services
- Advanced automation features planned for later roadmap phases

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete Agent OS integration with all necessary workflow files and documentation
2. Clear processes for team members to contribute professional profile updates using Agent OS standards
3. Enhanced collaborative documentation standards that support both individual profile management and team-wide improvements
