# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Sub-Agents Enhancement for Repository Development and Maintenance
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Add specialized sub-agents to enhance the TeamResumes repository's development and maintenance capabilities through automated tasks, intelligent monitoring, and proactive assistance. This will improve code quality, reduce manual maintenance overhead, and provide specialized expertise for different aspects of the project.

### Future Update Prompt

For future modifications to this spec, use the following prompt:
```
Update the sub-agents enhancement spec to include:
- New sub-agent types or specialized capabilities
- Enhanced automation workflows and triggers
- Integration with additional development tools
- Improved AI coordination and communication patterns
Maintain compatibility with existing Agent OS structure and ensure sub-agents work seamlessly with current workflows.
```

## User Stories

### Automated Code Quality Maintenance

As a development team member, I want sub-agents to automatically monitor and maintain code quality, so that I can focus on feature development while ensuring consistent standards and best practices.

Sub-agents should automatically detect code quality issues, suggest improvements, update documentation, and maintain project consistency without manual intervention. They should work continuously in the background and provide intelligent alerts when human attention is needed.

### Specialized Development Assistance

As a developer working on different aspects of the project, I want specialized sub-agents with domain expertise, so that I can get targeted help for resume processing, PDF generation, LinkedIn content, and other specific tasks.

Different sub-agents should have specialized knowledge about resume formatting, document conversion, social media content generation, and other domain-specific tasks. They should provide expert guidance and automation for their respective areas.

### Proactive Project Maintenance

As a project maintainer, I want sub-agents to proactively identify and address maintenance needs, so that the repository stays healthy and up-to-date without constant manual oversight.

Sub-agents should monitor dependencies, track project health metrics, identify potential issues before they become problems, and suggest or implement preventive maintenance tasks automatically.

## Spec Scope

1. **Code Quality Agent** - Automated code review, formatting, and best practices enforcement
2. **Documentation Agent** - Automatic documentation updates, consistency checks, and generation
3. **Resume Processing Agent** - Specialized assistance for resume formatting, validation, and conversion
4. **Content Generation Agent** - LinkedIn posts, social media content, and marketing materials
5. **Maintenance Agent** - Dependency updates, security monitoring, and project health checks
6. **Agent Coordination System** - Communication and task coordination between sub-agents

## Out of Scope

- Direct integration with external APIs without user approval
- Autonomous code commits without human review
- Modification of business logic without explicit instruction
- Access to sensitive personal or financial information

## Expected Deliverable

1. Sub-agent configuration and management system
2. Specialized agent definitions with clear capabilities and boundaries
3. Coordination protocols for multi-agent workflows
4. Integration with existing Agent OS and Claude Code workflows
