## User Stories

### Consistent Professional Presence

As a technical professional, I want to maintain consistent information across all my professional platforms, so that my personal brand is cohesive and up-to-date without manual synchronization.

Users need their skills, experience, and achievements to be consistently represented across resume, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, GitHub profile, and other platforms. Updates made to one source should propagate to relevant platforms automatically or with minimal effort.

### Content Generation for Social Media

As a team member, I want to generate engaging social media content from my professional achievements, so that I can maintain an active online presence that showcases my expertise and projects.

Team members should be able to convert resume achievements into LinkedIn posts, tweets, GitHub profile updates, and other social content formats. The system should suggest content based on recent work and industry trends.

### Personal Brand Analytics

As a professional, I want to track how my personal branding efforts perform across platforms, so that I can optimize my online presence and focus on what works best.

Users should understand which content resonates with their audience, track engagement across platforms, and receive suggestions for improving their personal brand visibility and impact.

## Spec Scope

1. **Cross-Platform Sync** - Synchronize professional information across resume, LinkedIn, X/Twitter, GitHub
2. **Content Generation** - Generate platform-specific content from resume data and recent work
3. **Brand Consistency Checker** - Validate that information is consistent across all platforms
4. **Social Media Templates** - Pre-built templates for LinkedIn posts, tweets, and other content
5. **Achievement Tracking** - Track and showcase new skills, projects, and accomplishments

## Out of Scope

- Direct API integrations with social media platforms (manual copy-paste acceptable for MVP)
- Advanced analytics beyond basic tracking
- Automated posting (focus on content generation)
- Personal website creation (may be future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Scripts and tools for generating platform-specific content from resume data
2. Templates for LinkedIn posts, X/Twitter content, and GitHub profile updates
3. Brand consistency validation tools
4. Documentation for managing personal branding workflows
