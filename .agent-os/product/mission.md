## The Problem

### Fragmented Professional Documentation

Technical teams often struggle with maintaining consistent, up-to-date professional documentation across multiple platforms and formats. This leads to outdated resumes, inconsistent team presentations, and dependency on third-party services.

**Our Solution:** Centralized markdown-based system with automated conversion to professional formats.

### Manual LinkedIn Content Management

Professionals spend significant time manually updating LinkedIn profiles with new skills and experiences, often leading to stale or inconsistent online presence.

**Our Solution:** Quick integration to generate LinkedIn sections that increase professional visibility.

Unlike external resume builders or LinkedIn-only approaches, we provide complete control over professional documentation without vendor lock-in. This results in consistent branding and data ownership.
