## 2025-01-24: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

TeamResumes will be an in-house markdown-based resume management system focused on maintaining team professional documentation without third-party dependencies, with quick integration capabilities for LinkedIn visibility enhancement.

### Context

The team needs a reliable way to maintain current professional documentation for client presentations and job opportunities. Existing solutions either require external platforms (creating vendor lock-in) or lack the technical workflow integration that engineering teams prefer. The decision was made to build an internal solution that leverages familiar tools like markdown, git, and automated conversion processes.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **External Resume Builders (LinkedIn, Canva, etc.)**
   - Pros: Professional templates, easy sharing, cloud storage
   - Cons: Vendor lock-in, limited customization, data ownership concerns

2. **Word/Google Docs Approach**
   - Pros: Familiar interface, easy collaboration, built-in formatting
   - Cons: Version control issues, format inconsistencies, no automation

3. **LaTeX-Based System**
   - Pros: Professional output, precise formatting, version control friendly
   - Cons: Steep learning curve, complex setup, limited team adoption

### Rationale

The markdown-based approach provides the best balance of technical workflow integration, version control, automation potential, and team accessibility. It aligns with existing engineering practices while providing the flexibility to evolve the system based on team needs.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Complete control over data and formatting
- Natural integration with git workflows
- Ability to automate and customize conversion processes
- No vendor dependencies or subscription costs
- Version controlled history of professional development

**Negative:**
- Requires initial setup and tooling configuration
- Team must learn markdown formatting conventions
- Custom styling requires CSS knowledge
- PDF generation depends on external tools (pandoc, wkhtmltopdf)

## 2025-01-24: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use Pandoc + wkhtmltopdf for document conversion with Python automation scripts, while remaining open to evaluating better conversion approaches as they emerge.

### Context

The team needed a reliable way to convert markdown resumes to professional PDF format. The current implementation uses pandoc for markdown-to-HTML conversion followed by wkhtmltopdf for HTML-to-PDF conversion, but there are known quality issues that may require future improvements.

### Rationale

This approach provides a working solution today while maintaining flexibility to upgrade the conversion pipeline. The modular design allows swapping out conversion tools without changing the core markdown workflow.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Working automated PDF generation
- Separation of content (markdown) from presentation (CSS/conversion)
- Ability to experiment with different conversion tools

**Negative:**
- Multi-step conversion process introduces complexity
- Output quality may not match professional design tools
- Dependency on external conversion utilities
