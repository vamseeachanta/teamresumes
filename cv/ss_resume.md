## Projects

### Template library for data science calculations

- Developed a simple python library for data science calculations using Python. (<https://github.com/samdansk2/librarytemplate>)
- Utilized branches to step through calculation phases
- This application is benchmark for beginners as a good  start with public libraries and used for internal training of new members for the company.

### Bsee Web Scraper 

 - Built and optimized a Scrapy-based web scraper to automate the extraction of data from the Bureau of 
   Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) website.     
 - Enhanced data processing by integrating Scrapy's FormRequest for efficient form submission.
 - Leveraged Python's pandas to process and validate extracted data directly from HTTP responses.
 - Part of energydata (<https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energydata>) repository for getting data from public sources.

### Automated Analysis and Summarization Of MES File Warnings and Errors

- Developed a Python-based tool to automate the analysis of warnings and errors from MES files.
- Implemented regular expressions to parse and extract warnings and errors.
- Generated a status table indicating the presence of warnings and errors in each file.
- Reduced the time required for MES file analysis , providing clear insights for project teams.

### Engineering Physics Based calculations - Cathodic Protection

- Developed a module for cathodic protection engineering calculations using Python .
- Part of digitalmodel (<https://github.com/vamseeachanta/digitalmodel>) repository for engineering physics based calculations.
- Calculated the cathodic protection for the following structures:
  - ships
  - pipelines

### Engineering Physics Based calculations - Plate Buckling
