## Projects

### Template library for data science calculations

- Developed a simple python library for data science calculations using Python. (<https://github.com/samdansk2/librarytemplate>)
- Utilized branches to step through calculation phases
- This application is benchmark for beginners as a good  start with public libraries and used for internal training of new members for the company.

### Web Scraper 

 - Built and optimized a Scrapy-based web scraper to automate the extraction of data from the Bureau of 
   Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) website.     
 - Enhanced data processing by integrating Scrapy's FormRequest for efficient form submission.
 - Leveraged Python's pandas to process and validate extracted data directly from HTTP responses.
 - Part of energydata (<https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energydata>) repository for getting data from public sources.

### Oil and Gas Data Analysis (BSEE)

The project's main aim is to focus on leveraging data analytics to enhance safety, environmental protection, and regulatory oversight in offshore energy operations. 
Main key tasks include:
- Data Extraction: Extracting data from the BSEE website using Scrapy. 
- Data Analysis: Performing data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to present the analysis results effectively.

### MES Files Analysis 

- Developed a Python-based tool to automate the analysis of warnings and errors from MES files.
- Implemented regular expressions to parse and extract warnings and errors.
- Generated a status table indicating the presence of warnings and errors in each file.
- Reduced the time required for MES file analysis , providing clear insights for project teams.

### Engineering Physics Based calculations

- Developed a module for cathodic protection and plate buckling calculations using Python.
- Part of digitalmodel (<https://github.com/vamseeachanta/digitalmodel>) repository for engineering physics based calculations.
- Calculated the cathodic protection for the following structures:
  - ships
  - subsea structures
  - pipelines
