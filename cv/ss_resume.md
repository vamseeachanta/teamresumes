## Projects

### Template library for data science calculations

- Developed a simple python library for data science calculations using Python. (<https://github.com/samdansk2/librarytemplate>)
- Utilized branches to step through calculation phases
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment of the library.
- This application is benchmark for beginners as a good  start with public libraries and used for internal training of new members for the company.

### Open Source Repository (AssetUtilities) Contributions

- **Environment Management**
  - Developed a Python-based tool to automate the management of virtual environments using Poetry.

- **File management**
  - Created a Python script to automate the process of file renaming and organization based on user-defined rules.
  - Implemented robust tests to ensure the reliability of the file management tool.

### Web Scraper 

 - Built and optimized a Scrapy-based web scraper to automate the data extraction process from public websites.    
 - Enhanced the data processing pipeline by implementing data validation and transformation steps.
 - Reduced the time required for data extraction and validation through automation, improving overall efficiency.
 - part of assetutilities (<https://github.com/vamseeachanta/assetutilities>) for automation of development processes.

### Oil and Gas Data Analysis (BSEE)

- Data Extraction: Extracting well, production and field data from the BSEE website 
  - Used Scrappy 
  - Direct read from bulk data zip files to save data and time.
- Data Analysis: Performing data analysis to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.
  - Analyze data by well
  - group by block
  - group by field
- Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to present the analysis results effectively.
  - matplotlib for static charts
  - plotly for interactive charts
- Work documented and code contributed to open-source python repository "EnergyData" <https://github.com/vamseeachanta/energydata>, which is an ideal tool for data extraction and analysis from public data sources.

### Analytical Program Output Files Analysis 

- Developed a Python-based tool to automate the analysis of warnings and errors for the following program output files
  - ANSYS AQWA MES files
  - Orcaflex .SIM file output statistics (start time, end time failures, etc.)
- Implemented regular expressions to parse and extract warnings and errors.
- Reduced the time required to identify failures in bulk runs thus providing clear insights for project teams.

### Engineering Physics Based calculations

- Developed a module for cathodic protection and plate buckling calculations using Python.
- Part of digitalmodel (<https://github.com/vamseeachanta/digitalmodel>) repository for engineering physics based calculations.
- Calculated the cathodic protection for the following structures:
  - ships
  - subsea structures
  - pipelines
